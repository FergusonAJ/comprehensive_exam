\chapter{Proposed - Patterns in potentiation across representations}
\label{chap:varying_representations}

\noindent
Authors: Austin Ferguson and Charles Ofria

\noindent
Status: This chapter is an alternative proposal for Chapter \ref{chap:simplified_model}. 
Both chapters look at potentiation in a representation other than Avida. 
While I lean toward Chapter \ref{chap:simplified_model} over this one, if I were to select this one I would swap the order around, doing this chapter after Chapter \ref{chap:varying_environments} so that I would have a baseline of how the multi-patch harvesting behavior becomes potentiated in Avida to compare with the other representation in this chapter. 
Additionally, all other chapters require minimal software development, while this chapter requires the implementation of Markov brains in MABE2.
