% Intro
    % How far to go into the history that Anselmo covered?
        % Mention the bilateral cognition angle
            % But not too far into it
    % Bring memory use up into the intro?
        % This could be a useful angle, mention that they might use the simplest memory possible - exactly one bit
% Exploratory work
    % Methods
        % Similar setup to previous chapter: new Avida
        % Describe the new environment 
        % Describe current analyses
    % Results
        % We see a variety of behaviors evolving
        % Show that the distribution of behaviors differs with environments
        % Show that we do have patch switching behaviors evolve
% Proposed work
    % Analyses
        % Analyzing lineages that evolved complex behaviors
            % What stepping stones were there? 
                % Did they traverse through multiple behaviors before ending up at the complex one?
            % Performing replay analyses to identify potentiation
    % Hypotheses
