Authors: Austin Ferguson, Anselmo Pontes, and Charles Ofria

Status: Proposed. %but all software has been developed as part of previous work.
%One environment comes from work that is currently only published as a chapter in Anselmo Pontes' dissertation \citep{pontesEvolutionaryOriginsCognition2021}. 
%The other environment is a variant of the Logic 9 environment used in Chapter \ref{chap:consequences_of_plasticity} to study plasticity. 
%I propose to study potentiation in two environments, both of which have been ported from Avida2 to MABE2 and are ready to be used. 
While data collection has not started, both environments I propose to explore have been ported from Avida2 to MABE2 and are ready to be used. 
%Part of this extension will focus on potentiation in the patch harvesting environment, looking at lineages that evolved the memory necessary to switch from consuming one patch to finding another. 
%This has all been implemented in Avida in MABE2, as well as the Logic 9 environment we use to replicate the plasticity environment seen in Chapter \ref{chap:varying_environments}.
% As we work to get the work ready to publish, I first re-implemented the system in the new, in-progress version of Avida with MABE2 and begun re-running all the data from the previous work. 
% My intellectual contribution is a deeper dive into the genotypes that heavily exploit a patch and then move on in search for a new patch. 
% While the previous work looked at one lineage, my plan is to look into \textit{all} lineages that exhibit this behavior. 
% Additionally, I plan to conduct analytic replay experiments on these lineages to see how the potentiation of patch-hopping behavior changed over time.
