\chapter{In-progress - A deeper exploration of potentiation in associative learning}
\label{chap:replaying_associative_learning}

\noindent
Authors: Austin Ferguson and Charles Ofria

\noindent
Status: This is a direct extension of Chapter \ref{chap:alife_submission}.
It is marked in-progress as all software has been implemented and additional explorations beyond Chapter \ref{chap:alife_submission} have been conducted to identify useful changes to parameters and the environment. 
The actual data collection, however, has yet to begin. 
Note that this chapter may make Chapter \ref{chap:alife_submission} redundant in the final dissertation.
Both are included here, however, as Chapter \ref{chap:alife_submission} serves as preliminary results for this chapter.
