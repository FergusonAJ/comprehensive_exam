\label{chap:simplified_model}
\noindent
Authors: Austin Ferguson and Charles Ofria

\noindent
Status: Proposal. A small sample of preliminary data has been collected to help estimate time requirements and to verify that we do see meaningful levels of potentiation in NK landscapes. 

% \noindent
% Note: This chapter is proposed as an \textit{alternative} to Chapter \ref{06_potentiation_across_representations}; I do not currently plan on doing both.
% Chapter \ref{06_potentiation_across_representations} is a significant undertaking, so this project serves as a lower-cost alternative that gets at the same underlying idea of investigating potentiation outside Avida. 
% While I lean toward doing Chapter \ref{06_potentiation_across_representations}, I hope to graduate in a year and understand if my committee favors this safer option.
